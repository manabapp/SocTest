<center>Chapter 6. Address Manager<br><a href="help.html">SOCTEST - USER'S GUIDE</a></center><br>

In this chapter, it describes about the address management.<p>

In Address Manager view, creates, deletes and rearranges an address.<p>

<h1>Creation an address</h1>
With tapping <b>New Address</b>, moves to the next address input view and creats a new address.<br>
The created addrsses are listed in Address Manager view.<p>

The maximum number of addresses that can be registered is 32.<p>

This app does an external network communication via IPv4 socket, and an inter process communication via UNIX domain socket.<br>
Creates each in the AF_INET / AF_UNIX family address format, and uses it as the destination or listening address.<p>
<br>

<h2>AF_INET address</h2>
Regists the pair of host and port number in address input view.<br>
If specifies host with a FQDN, you can regist only when the host name can be resolved with DNS. Other than that, no restrictions on registered addresses, including multicast and broadcast.<p>

When you regist as a listening address, specifies the address of these interfaces or ANY address (0.0.0.0).<br>
See <a href="Chapter5.html">Chapter 5. Interface Configuration</a> about an interace's address.<p>

<h2>AF_UNIX address</h2>
Specifies and regists a file name (UNIX path) that is the substance of UNIX domain address.<br>
When an UNIX domain socket is assigned the address, a socket file will be created by kernel. Inter process communication is realized with this file.<p>

[Note]<br>
In general, specifies a full path as an address. But, this app uses a relative path.<p>
<br>

<h1>Deletion an address</h1>
With swiping left a row, deletes the address.<br>
When AF_UNIX address, deletes the corresponding socket file together.<p>
<br>

<h1>Rearranging addresses</h1>
With tapping <b>Edit</b> at the top right to enter edit mode.<br>
Reorders the addresses for ease of use.<p>
