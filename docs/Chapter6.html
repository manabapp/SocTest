<center>Chapter 6. Address Manager<br><a href="help.html">SOCTEST - USER'S GUIDE</a></center><br>

In this chapter, it describes about the address management.<p>

In Address Manager view, creates and deletes an address.<br>
And, confirms the IP address of your iOS device.<p>

<h1>Confirms device address</h1>
With tapping the row of <b>DEVICE ADDRESS</b>, redisplays the address.<br>
In case an address switched between 3G/4G (Cellular) and Wi-Fi, you can check again the current IP address.<p>

The IP address displayed in here is Cellular or W-Fi for external network communication.<p>
<br>

<h1>Creation an address</h1>
With tapping <b><img src="img/Add.png" height=36px>New Address</b>, moves to the next address input view and creats a new address.<br>
The created addrsses are listed in Address Manager view.<p>

This app does an external network communication via IPv4 socket, and an inter process communication via UNIX domain socket.<br>
Creates each in the AF_INET / AF_UNIX family address format, and uses it as the destination or listening address.<p>

<h2>AF_INET address</h2>
Regists the pair of host and port number in address input view.<br>
The maximum number of addresses that can be registered is 16.<p>

If specifies host with a FQDN, you can regist only when the host name can be resolved with DNS. Other than that, no restrictions on registered addresses, including multicast and broadcast.<p>

For doing IPv4 communication, the following network interfaces are avairable in iOS.<br>
When you regist as a listening address, specifies the address of these interfaces or ANY address (0.0.0.0).<br>
For a server socket, assigns the address with bind(2).<p>

<table>
<tr><th>Network<br>Interface</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Cellular</td><td>Connects the Mobile carrier network provided by MNO, starts IPv4 communication.<br>
Needs to enable the following settings.<p>
<ul>
<li>[Settings] &gt; [Cellular] &gt; [soctest], or
<li>[Settings] &gt; [soctest] &gt; [Cellular Data]
</ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>Wi-fi</td><td>Connects the Wi-Fi network, starts IPv4 communication.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Personal<br>Hotspot</td><td>Personal Hotspot feature allows an iOS device to work as a mobile router and connect (relay) other devices to the Cellular network.<br>
With using the feature, you can start IPv4 communication between this app and other device on local network (172.20.10.0/28).<br>
The IP address of interface is fixed to 172.20.10.1.<p>

Needs to enable the following settings.<p>
<ul>
<li>[Settings] &gt; [Privacy] &gt; [Local Network] &gt; [soctest], or
<li>[Settings] &gt; [soctest] &gt; [Local Network]
</ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>Loopback</td><td>With using 127.0.0.1 (hostname: localhost), starts IPv4 loopback communication.</td></tr>
</table><p>
<br>

<h2>AF_UNIX address</h2>
Specifies and regists a socket file name that is the substance of UNIX domain address.<br>
The maximum number of addresses that can be registered is 16.<p>

When an UNIX domain socket is assigned the address, a socket file will be created by kernel. Inter process communication is realized with this file.<p>

[Supplement]<br>
In general, specifies a full path as an address. But, this app uses a relative path.<br>
If you want to know a current directory, confirms the debug log at app launching. See <a>Chapter 7. Menu</a> about the debug log.<p>
<br>

<h1>Deletion an address</h1>
With swiping left a row, deletes the address.<br>
When AF_UNIX address, deletes the corresponding socket file together.<p>
